I have also programmed projects using SQL, JavaScript, Web Technologies, C#, and Blueprint Scripting. I went to school at Southern Oregon University where I received a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. IT just seems like the good fit for the skills I already have._

    > _During my time at Revature, I've built various projects applying Situational Layer Cake methodology and ECS techniques during the Pega design process. Throughout several projects I strengthened my skillset in designing software for Business process management (BPM), Digital process automation and customer relationship management (CRM). I have 11 years of experience leading and managing teams with constantly revolving rosters and a variety of skill levels in high-stress high stakes scenarios with limited time. I am skilled at planning and maintaining several projects simultaneously that may deploy either at the same time or separately and with or without my direct involvement. I look forward to integrating with your team and applying my skills and knowledge to streamline and improve your business processes._
